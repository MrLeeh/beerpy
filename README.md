The beerpy package contains a collection of brewing calculation functions to
make the brewers life a little bit easier. This collection is intended to grow
in complexety and hopefully in usefulness by time.

Features
--------

### Calculate alcohol from original wort and rest wort

Make a rough calculation with only the original wort:

```python
>>> from beerpy.alcohol import alcohol
>>> from beerpy.gravity import Gravity, PL
>>> alcohol(Gravity(12, unit=PL))
Alcohol: 4.5%

```

Make a more exact calculation with original and rest wort:

```python
>>> from beerpy.alcohol import alcohol
>>> from beerpy.gravity import Gravity, PL
>>> alcohol(Gravity(12, unit=PL), Gravity(6, PL))
Alcohol: 3%

```

### Calculate the malt composition for a specific receipe

A receipe should result in 20l of wort with a specific gravity of 18.
The composition should contain 80% of Pilsener malt and 20% of Munich
malt.

```python
>>> malt_composition(20, 20, [(PILSENER_MALT, 0.8), (MUNICH_MALT, 0.2)])
(6.93, [('Pilsener Malz', 5.54), ('MÃ¼nchener Malz', 1.39)])

```

As result an amount of 6.93kg of malt is needed.
5.54kg of Pilsener malt and 1.39kg of Munich malt.
